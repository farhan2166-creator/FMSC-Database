# FMSC private Git updater — manual publishing, no publisher signing keys

**Status:** The updater is integrated. The owner-approved first production baseline is application 1.0.0, database 1; the private distribution was reset before its first production publication. See [the baseline decision](FIRST_RELEASE_BASELINE.md).

## Owner decisions

- `FMSC-Source` contains app source and the existing CI. It is **currently
  public**; the owner plans to make it private later.
- `FMSC-Updates` is a **separate private** GitHub repository used ONLY to
  distribute approved packages and release metadata.
- The owner **manually publishes** approved updates. There is **NO separate
  RSA publisher signature, signing private key, public-key pinning, encrypted
  signing-key backup or GitHub Actions signing secret** requirement.
- No VPS, hosted broker, licensing API, external SQL service or school GitHub
  user accounts.
- Each authorized school Windows user/computer generates a unique SSH key pair.
  Only its PUBLIC deploy key is added to `FMSC-Updates` with **Allow write
  access UNCHECKED**. Its private key is stored under
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\FMSC\\Updates` sealed by Windows DPAPI CurrentUser.
  Windows login changes/reinstalls may require re-enrollment.
- Account → **Check for Updates** is manual; no automatic program shutdown,
  replacement, or database migrations while the school works.
- Prefer a changed-file incremental download for an EXACT matching installed
  version and file inventory. Otherwise use the full package.
- A database schema mismatch routes to the existing guarded installer/migration
  workflow. App-only staging must never bypass the SQL backup/migration guards.
- Preserve school data/MDF/LDF, installation identity, recovery backups and
  all needed numbered SQL migrations. Application and schema versions are
  **unchanged**; resetting either to 1 is deferred.

## Trust and verification

GitHub private repository write permissions control **who may publish**.
Authorized school devices use **read-only SSH** with GitHub's known SSH host
key pinned. They access only the update distribution repository.

The manifest includes SHA-256 checksums and sizes for archive pieces, full
ZIP/delta ZIP and all installed application files. Clients verify these before
staging. These checks detect corrupted, incomplete or mismatched downloads.

**Limit:** Hashes in a manifest are NOT a digital signature. Someone who gains
write access to `FMSC-Updates` could replace a package AND its hashes.
Protect the owner's GitHub account (2FA) and repository write privileges.
This is an intentionally accepted security trade-off for manual distribution.

No source code, database files, application signing secret or school SSH private
key is published in `FMSC-Updates`.

## Update format and distribution layout

```text
channel/stable.json
versions/<version>/update-manifest.json
versions/<version>/FMSC_SMS-app-full.zip.part0001
versions/<version>/FMSC_SMS-app-full.zip.part0002
versions/<version>/FMSC_SMS-app-incremental.zip.part0001
...
```

`Tools/UpdatePackages` produces a complete ZIP, optional changed-file delta,
a JSON manifest with SHA-256 hashes and deterministic <=90 MiB chunk files.
Its local unchunked ZIP is a build intermediate and must NOT be pushed into Git.

Example local packaging on the approved build output:

```powershell
dotnet run --project Tools/UpdatePackages/UpdatePackages.csproj -c Release -- `
  --current-dir <approved-publish-directory> `
  --output-dir <new-empty-package-directory> `
  --version <approved-application-version> `
  --schema <approved-database-schema>
```

To prepare an incremental package also supply `--previous-dir` and
`--previous-version` from the last approved build. The latest FULL package
must always be available so schools can skip missed versions.

`Tools/UpdateDistribution` creates a checked, independent publishing snapshot:

```powershell
dotnet run --project Tools/UpdateDistribution/UpdateDistribution.csproj -c Release -- `
  --new-package-dir <package-directory> `
  --output-dir <new-snapshot-directory>
```

For a later release, also specify `--previous-snapshot-dir` pointing to
the last published verified snapshot. This tool checks metadata structure,
part sizes, per-part hashes and reconstructed ZIP hashes and retains only
the two latest versions in the NEW snapshot. It never performs a Git push.

The owner must publish a **fully validated snapshot atomically** to
`FMSC-Updates`. Automated Git push/atomic-promotion/history management is
not implemented yet; do NOT copy half a release into the live feed.

## Two-version retention

| New version | Keep in latest tree | Retire from latest tree |
|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | 1.1 | — |
| 1.2 | 1.1, 1.2 | — |
| 1.3 | 1.2, 1.3 | 1.1 |
| 1.4 | 1.3, 1.4 | 1.2 |

Never remove the older version before the newest complete package and manifest
pass every check. A school left on 1.1 when 1.4 is released must still be able
to install the full 1.4 release, with ALL required intervening SQL migrations.

Removing old update files from the current tree **does not reclaim historical
Git blobs**. A bounded distribution history strategy remains a separate
production gate, limited to `FMSC-Updates`; never rewrite the source history.

## Implemented updater components

- `Core/Updates/UpdateManifest.cs`: validated JSON manifest, path, version,
  inventory and SHA-256 structure, exact-baseline incremental selection,
  full fallback, database-schema installer gate.
- `Core/Updates/UpdateChunks.cs`: deterministic bounded chunking and
  independently checked chunk/whole-archive reconstruction.
- `Core/Updates/UpdateStager.cs`: isolated complete application staging;
  exact file inventory + hashes; never overwrites the live installation.
- `Core/Updates/UpdateDeviceKey.cs`: separate read-only SSH key for an enrolled
  Windows user, with DPAPI-protected private key.
- `Core/Updates/UpdateGitSession.cs`: private read-only Git transport with
  pinned GitHub SSH host key, shallow metadata fetch and bounded chunk streaming.
- `Core/Updates/UpdateGitReader.cs`: manually initiated connection and
  update-version check without a publisher-signature requirement.
- `Core/Updates/UpdateReleasePreparer.cs`: checks repository manifest
  metadata, selects a delta or full update, verifies downloaded chunks,
  reconstructs the ZIP, and prepares the target in an isolated directory.
- `MainDashboardForm.cs` + `UpdateConnectionForm.cs`: Account → Check for
  Updates, generate/copy computer's PUBLIC SSH key, test private Git access.
- `Tools/UpdatePackages`, `Tools/UpdateDistribution` and their regression
  fixtures: package creation and safe two-version snapshot preparation.
- Windows Git enrollment/DPAPI tests and existing desktop CI checks.
- `Tools/PrepareMaintenanceTools.ps1` and `Installer/ToolCatalog.json`: one approved
  catalog for Git/OpenSSH, sqlcmd and the LocalDB MSI. Local publishing verifies
  the owner's cached tools without downloads; release workflows explicitly download
  missing tools and package complete integrity manifests. Git's full runtime and
  notices remain under `UpdateTransport/`; SQL bundles are under
  `UpdateSupport/Tools/SqlCmd/` and `UpdateSupport/Tools/LocalDb/`.
- `Installer/MaintenanceTools.ps1`: installation retains verified versions under
  `%ProgramData%\FMSC_Updater\MaintenanceTools`, outside application activation,
  rollback and transaction cleanup. Update checks use an absolute verified Git/SSH
  pair from this protected cache. Activation/recovery resolves sqlcmd there too.
  Missing/corrupt bundles are restored from the application, then approved HTTPS
  sources if necessary, independently of Git and the original setup folder.
  Machine-cache repair can require UAC; unchanged tools require no rewrite/download.

**Removed:** owner-only `Tools/UpdateSigning`, RSA signature generation,
`update-manifest.sig`, pinned publisher public-key resource, recovery backup
requirements, and all signing-key parameters from packaging and snapshot CLI.
The school's **SSH authorization key is separate** and is still required.

## Remaining production gates

1. Test real private Git downloads, revoked deploy keys, network interruption,
   oversized archives, Windows file-lock behavior and constrained disk space.
2. The Windows x64 release builds now pin and SHA-256 verify Git for Windows
   MinGit 2.56.0(4), and include its entire Git/OpenSSH runtime inside both
   the application-only update and complete installer. Publishing fails when
   required tools are absent. Validate first-install and private SSH transfer
   behavior on a clean Windows school/test PC before production rollout.
3. Complete field acceptance of reconnect/resume under actual network disruption.
   Verified chunk caching, bounded retries, live transfer figures and a determinate
   download bar are implemented and covered by fault-injection tests. Close cancels
   preparation and preserves verified chunks. Remind Me Later dismisses this manual
   check (it does not schedule a notification).
4. Complete disposable Windows/LocalDB acceptance of the connected installer
   handoff, including actual pre-migration backup, migration and rollback recovery.
5. Accept the guarded manual publisher described below against the private
   distribution. Long-term history rotation still needs a concrete reviewed
   maintenance procedure and owner approval before any destructive operation.
6. Run release-readiness, Windows UI and full integration tests before asking
   for merge or installation at any school.

No GitHub source visibility change, database migration, update publication,
live installation change or app/schema version reset has been performed.

## Owner publication review and atomic push

### Normal developer path: one manual GitHub workflow

Use the existing **04 - Build and Publish Private Update** workflow on `main`.
`publish_update` defaults to true; disable it only for an artifact-only build.
After editing and testing locally, increase the application version in both
`FMSC_SMS.csproj` and `Installer/core.ps1`, push approved source to main, and
select Run workflow. The workflow uses that checked-in version; it does not
invent, reset or commit a version number. A duplicate published version is refused.

One-time credential setup: create a fine-grained GitHub personal access token
limited to **FMSC-Updates**, with **Contents: Read and write**, and store it as
the **FMSC_UPDATES_PUBLISH_TOKEN** Actions repository secret in **FMSC-Source**.
The ordinary source GITHUB_TOKEN cannot write a different private repository.
Do not paste the token into source, workflow inputs, school enrollment or the app.
School computers continue to use their individual read-only SSH deploy keys.

The workflow builds/tests the source, publishes the self-contained application,
fetches the current private snapshot, reconstructs and verifies its full package
as an incremental baseline when schemas match, and uses the existing packaging
and distribution tools. If schemas differ, it prepares a full update. It verifies
every chunk/ZIP and reconstructs the complete target from both new archives before
publication. The log/summary identifies version, schema, sizes, retained/retired
versions and expected Git parent before the final atomic push. Concurrent runs are
serialized; a concurrent external distribution update is rejected without force.
Failures before the push leave the current school feed unchanged. Source and school
databases are never modified by this workflow.

The owner publishing credential is provided only to the runner's Git processes,
never saved in a remote URL, application or downloadable artifact. The public source
workflow retains its existing current-application artifact. Private baseline packages,
history and distribution snapshots stay in runner temporary storage and are not
uploaded as public artifacts. GitHub no-reply commit identity avoids email-privacy
push rejection. Buffered HTTPS publication supports the approved large chunks.

On the school side, publication does nothing until someone manually selects
Account → Check for Updates. There is no automatic download or forced installation.

The new orchestration is covered by offline trigger refusal, real package reconstruction
and local atomic-publication regressions. Its first authenticated GitHub run still
requires the owner's one-time secret configuration and manual Run workflow; it was
not invoked to publish a real update during development.

### Local CLI alternative

After preparing a verified two-version snapshot with the existing CLI:

```powershell
dotnet run --project Tools/UpdateDistribution -c Release -- --prepare-publication <snapshot-directory> --workspace <new-review-directory>
```

This fetches distribution `main` into a new disposable Git workspace. It
requires the snapshot to advance and retain the remote's current latest
version. Review the printed additions/deletions (including the retired version),
stored-object size and expected parent commit. Nothing is pushed at this step.
The owner uses their own Git write authorization, never a school's deploy key.
Configure the owner's normal Git commit identity before the next command.

Only after approval of that exact snapshot, the owner runs:

```powershell
dotnet run --project Tools/UpdateDistribution -c Release -- --publish-reviewed <review-directory> --expected-parent <printed-commit>
```

The tool revalidates manifests, chunk sizes, chunk hashes, combined archive
hashes and allowed files. It commits and pushes one ordinary fast-forward
update of `main`. Concurrent publication is rejected without force pushing.
After a rejected push, prepare a fresh workspace against the current remote.
No source repository history or distribution history is rewritten.

History storage is bounded by a conservative **1 GiB local Git object budget**:
preparation refuses further publication above it. This is a stop condition,
not a claim that tree retention deletes historical binaries or that local
object size equals GitHub billing. Plan reviewed archival/rotation before
reaching it; no automatic history cleanup is authorized or performed.

## Verification on 4 November 2026

- Release solution build: passed, zero warnings/errors. Standalone tool sources
  are excluded from the desktop project, including stale removed signing-tool output.
- Packaging/preparation regressions: passed (matching delta, older full update,
  corrupted delta full fallback, schema gate, isolated staging).
- Snapshot/publication regressions: passed against disposable local Git remotes,
  including two-version retention, no push during review, fast-forward ancestry,
  competing-publish rejection, corrupt parts and unexpected files.
- Windows authorization: 21 checks passed after correcting inherited directory
  permissions. Credential and transient plaintext SSH directories now allow
  only the current Windows user before private key material is written.
- Installer migration and LocalDB recovery contract suites: passed. These are
  offline safeguard checks, not real SQL migration/recovery acceptance.
- Windows post-fix control suite: failed communication tab navigation focus
  assertion in `Program.Communication.cs`. The assertion checks deferred focus
  transfer in `Core/TabStrip.cs`; it remains unresolved. No communication or
  tab navigation code was changed for the updater.
- Python release checks could not run: Python is unavailable on this machine.

## Connected installer handoff (follow-up implementation)

- Published applications now include `UpdateSupport/core.ps1` and all numbered
  migrations. Their bytes are covered by the same full/incremental file manifest.
  The production packaging CLI refuses version/schema values that differ from
  the published application DLL and bundled installer, and refuses missing migrations.
- The existing update window opens without blocking dashboard work. Only one
  window is opened. Schema-changing releases can download a full package without
  running SQL during preparation.
- Install Update is enabled only after handoff validation of the staged inventory,
  installer version and schema. Dashboard unsaved/busy guards and explicit close
  confirmation precede launch; the normal close guard remains active.
- The existing installer runs in an elevated external PowerShell process, waits
  for the original process identity to exit, and refuses another Windows user.
  If closure is cancelled, it times out without replacing files or running SQL.
  Automatic handoff supports the existing standard installation directory only.
  Disposable Level 2 builds cannot initiate activation.
- Update mode requires the existing MDF and LDF. Its template paths are disabled;
  a missing school database fails instead of creating/replacing one. Existing
  database registration/identity checks, verified pre-migration backup, sequential
  numbered migrations, compatibility check and folder activation/rollback are reused.
- Hash/inventory checks run again after process exit and against the installer copy
  before migrations. An exclusive installer mutex prevents concurrent activation.
  Restart remains the existing installer's success-only user choice.
- New offline tests cover process timeout/identity/user refusal, actual process-exit
  waiting, installer version/schema mismatch, changed/unlisted files, path traversal
  and database-payload refusal. They never launch activation or connect to SQL.
- Release build, authorization/handoff fixtures, migration and LocalDB safeguard
  checks passed. The disposable full PortableRelease publish passed, including
  installer and migration content checks. The local post-fix control rerun passed
  all 1,973 checks; the earlier communication-focus failure did not reproduce.
- Desktop CI run `41854489676` for the preceding commit passed every step,
  including Python checks, post-fix controls and admission/finance regressions.

**Not production complete:** The handoff is implemented and offline checks pass;
real activation/migration/recovery acceptance remains unverified. The later
MinGit bundling change still needs a successful release artifact and clean-PC
private SSH test; physical network-disruption and recovery acceptance remain required.
No live installer, database or distribution package was changed in these tests.

## Local private-distribution acceptance and dialog corrections

The owner authorized publication of `1.1.0-rc.2.test.1` and installation on the
owner's test PC using its ProgramData database, with the original detached pair
untouched. Publication commit `2adfe6a47339a673dea3bbd8b2e5d6495488e5f6` in the
private distribution was verified against the approved archive hashes. The real
school transport downloaded the incremental archive, installed all 391 expected
files and preserved 391 verified baseline files for rollback. The owner confirmed
existing records open and the manual checker reports up to date. Schema remained
76: this did not test actual SQL migration, backup restoration or rollback activation.

The owner's test exposed modeless dismissal and owner-close reentrancy defects.
Release `1.1.0-rc.3` fixes Close and Remind Me Later with explicit close handlers,
replaces the update window's FormClosed installation callback with a guarded
request, and launches the installer only after the dashboard accepts closure.
Cancelled confirmation or closure clears the pending update; ordinary later
closure cannot start it. The work guard runs once and duplicate requests are
suppressed. The dialog now separates version/download status, optional computer
access details and dismissal actions. A focused SQL-free WinForms suite reproduces
the owned-window close path and tests exactly one inert installer callback.

The owner has approved merging the source after these corrections. Further package
publication remains owner controlled. Bundled Git/SSH on a clean PC, disrupted-network field acceptance,
full transport acceptance and actual migration/recovery tests remain production
verification limitations; successful incremental testing does not close them.

## Download progress and recovery

The user-visible stages are Downloading → Verifying → Ready to Install in FMSC,
then Installing → Completed in the external installer after FMSC closes.
The percentage explicitly measures **Download**, never installation. A 100%
download continues through archive, staged-file and installer-handoff validation
before Ready to Install. Installation requires the user's separate action and
safe shutdown. Completed is shown only after activated-file and database checks.

Prepared updates launch elevated Windows PowerShell with its console hidden and
show a small Installing progress window instead. Existing installer pauses and
Y/N restart prompts are skipped for this path; ordinary full installation keeps
its interactive behavior. After verified activation, restart is delegated to the
existing Windows desktop shell, then the installer window and process exit.
Windows administrator consent and FMSC's existing safe-close confirmation remain.
Failure shows an attention dialog with the log and recovery paths, without
restarting FMSC. A missing desktop shell after successful installation asks the
user to open the normal shortcut instead of launching an elevated application.

### Interrupted installation recovery

Prepared installation now makes a verified protected snapshot under
`%ProgramData%/FMSC_Updater/transactions/<guid>` and installs a stable desktop
launcher outside the replaceable application directory before migrations run.
The shortcut targets a small GUI-subsystem `FMSC.Launcher.exe`, which starts the
existing PowerShell recovery script with `UseShellExecute=false` and
`CreateNoWindow=true`. Unlike hiding an already created PowerShell console, this
prevents the startup console flash. The bootstrap is compiled during the Windows
build and included in the hashed package; schools need no compiler or extra
runtime beyond the Windows Framework already used by Windows PowerShell.
Only Administrators/SYSTEM may modify recovery storage; users have read/execute
access. Links and weakened ownership/permissions are refused. The owner-published
installer/helper SHA-256 values are recorded locally; no publisher signing key is
introduced. Recovery uses no network or additional database.

The atomically replaced, flushed `recovery.json` records Prepared, Migrating,
Activating, Verified and Completed. Activation intent is committed before either
directory rename. Recovery preserves the transaction's original rollback copy,
rebuilds staging from the protected snapshot, verifies it and rechecks database
compatibility before activation. A separate durable verified manifest survives
partial cleanup. Verified is committed before deleting rollback or recovery
payloads; interrupted cleanup can therefore be retried without requiring those
payloads. Completed permits normal startup. The next update removes leftover
completed/orphaned protected snapshots, keeping recovery storage bounded.

The desktop launcher requests elevation to resume an unfinished update. Direct
application startup also checks local pending state before accessing the school
database and redirects to recovery. An active installer blocks concurrent startup;
the original Windows user is required for the same LocalDB identity. Invalid state,
modified recovery scripts, missing payloads or failed compatibility checks stop
with recovery instructions instead of opening an uncertain application.

Migrations read the actual database schema rather than trusting the journal's last
recorded migration. Earlier committed migrations are skipped; the remaining numbered
scripts still run sequentially under the existing transactional/version guards.
The original pre-migration backup path/hash and database GUID are retained and
checked on recovery. Recovery never overwrites that backup or automatically
restores/downgrades the database. A damaged backup, changed database identity or
failing migration requires support; existing data and recovery files are preserved.

`TestUpdateRecovery.ps1` actually kills child processes around directory renames
and during cleanup using disposable folders. Restricted local runs substitute a
fixture owner; elevated Windows CI checks production Administrators ownership.
`TestUpdateRecoverySql.ps1` is guarded to approved hosted disposable runners and
tests interrupted committed migrations, transactional failure, forward resume and
backup restoration into a second newly named fixture database. Physical power-loss,
disk/controller failure and complete-machine-loss recovery are separate limits;
local journaling cannot replace an independent school-data backup.

The complete Windows installation acceptance also invokes
`TestPreparedUpdateRecovery.ps1` against its already owned synthetic FMSC install.
Only the private fixture copy is instrumented: it pauses after the old-directory
rename, is forcibly terminated, and then the real stable launcher elevates and
resumes the existing installer. Installed files, unchanged fictional SQL records,
database GUID, user settings and cleanup are checked. Interactive restart is
observed at its verified-completion boundary rather than launching a login window
on the hosted runner. The activation mutex must be released before restart so
the application's startup guard permits the completed application to open.

Workflow 02 defaults to complete acceptance. Its optional `sql` test scope restores
the pinned test tooling and runs the billing and uniquely named disposable
migration/backup fixtures without rebuilding the Windows installer. Recovery tests
include AUTO_CLOSE databases, both PowerShell JSON integer representations and
UTF-8 download paths. None of these test modes publish an update or access school
database files.

The dialog displays download percentage, received/total bytes, remaining bytes,
network speed, elapsed time and estimated time remaining. Git's network pack
progress supplies speed measurements; local `git show` output is never treated
as network throughput. ETA is approximate and disappears while waiting, retrying,
verifying or staging. A half-second heartbeat keeps elapsed time moving during
quiet periods. Complete download remains distinct from validated installer readiness.

Network failures retry the current part with 2/4/8/16-second backoff, stopping
after five attempts. SSH keepalives detect dropped connections. Revoked keys,
repository authorization refusal and host-identity errors stop without retry loops.
Cancellation interrupts both the transfer and backoff; no running application file
or SQL operation is modified by recovery.

SHA-256-verified chunks are atomically retained under the current user's
`Updates/download-cache/<archive-sha256>` directory. A later attempt or reopened
dialog rechecks every cached chunk and fetches only missing/damaged ones. Incomplete
incoming files are discarded. Cache paths cannot overlap the live app or use links.
Git cannot resume a partly received blob at a byte offset: an unfinished chunk
restarts. New packages therefore prefer 16 MiB chunks; the existing 90 MiB maximum
remains accepted for older published packages. No manifest/version reset is needed.

Offline tests cover interrupted transfer, verified resume in a separate attempt,
damaged cache, retry exhaustion, backoff cancellation, revoked authorization,
speed/ETA arithmetic, stalled connections and full-fallback size/method changes.
The explicit `UpdateAuthorizationChecks --live-transfer` probe fetched a small
retained private part (1,777,043 bytes), observed real network progress and verified
its published hash using the existing computer key. The real download coordinator's
second attempt reused that verified cache without issuing another network request.
This probe is opt-in and is
never run by credential-free CI. It does not install or access SQL. Larger sustained
transfers and physical connection-loss acceptance remain separate field tests.

## Successful installation cleanup

After activation, the installer compares the installed application with its source,
checks the prepared manifest again and runs the existing database compatibility
check using the installed executable. Only after these checks succeed does it
remove the fixed `.rollback` application directory. Verification failures retain
the previous application and downloads for recovery. After successful
verification, the installer retains the newest two pre-migration backups in
`C:\ProgramData\FMSC_Database\Backups` and verifies both before deleting
older files with the installer’s pre-migration naming pattern. If verification
fails, all backups are retained. Regular school backups are outside this policy.

Successful prepared updates also remove their own `prepared-<guid>` directory
and hashed chunk-cache directories. The computer's enrollment key, database files
and regular database backups are outside this cleanup. Absolute-path checks and link
refusal limit recursive deletion. A locked file produces a cleanup warning without
turning a verified activation into a failed installation; the next successful
installation retries removal of the fixed rollback directory. Older staging
directories from installations predating this change are not swept automatically.
Disposable-folder tests exercise verification failures, successful cleanup,
locked files, scope refusal and preservation of enrollment and database backups.
